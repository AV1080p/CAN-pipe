A tool for creating a windows named pipe to capture CAN bus traffic using wireshark.

# Requirements:
- An arduino UNO or similar device.
- An MCP2515 based arduino shield.
- knowledge on how to prgram an arduino.
- a windows based computer.


# THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW
1. The code was written using visual studio 2017 community edition.
